## 3rd Year - 1st Semester LOGBOOKs & CTFs

### Brief description:

This repository contains practical exercises (LOGBOOKs) and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges for the Fundamentos de Segurança Informática (FSI) course at FEUP. The activities cover various security topics, including vulnerability exploitation, cryptographic attacks, and web security.

The LOGBOOKs consist of hands-on labs designed to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical application. The CTF challenges require problem-solving skills and security knowledge to find vulnerabilities and exploit them effectively.

I hope you find it useful!
